# This is the Kano version of Lightdm autostart script.
# It is run everytime the kit boots up, and each time a successful Greeter login takes place.
#
# It decides whether to go into Dashboard or Desktop mode via systemd services.
# Switching takes place by restarting systemd services, which makes it happen very fast.
# Look at /usr/lib/systemd/user Kano unit files for more details.
#
# Finally, this script does most of the old kano-uixinit tasks: mouse, keyboard setup,
# disabling screen DPMS, and Kano Tracking.
#
# To switch from either mode from a terminal or ssh session:
#
# $ kano-dashboard-uimode <dashboard | desktop>
