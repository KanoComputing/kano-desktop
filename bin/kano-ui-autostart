#  kano-ui-autostart
#
#  This is the Kano version of Lightdm autostart script.
#  It is run everytime the kit boots up, and each time a successful Greeter login takes place.
#
#  It decides wether to go into Dashboard or Desktop mode via systemd services.
#  Switching takes place by restarting systemd services, which makes it happen very fast.
#  Look at /usr/lib/systemd/user Kano unit files for more details.
#
#  Finally, this script does most of the old kano-uixinit tasks: mouse, keyboard setup,
#  disabling screen DPMS, and Kano Tracking.
#
#  To switch from either mode from a terminal or ssh session:
#
#  $ kano-dashboard-uimode <dashboard | desktop>
#

# FIXME: MANAGERPID is not exported, SHLVL=2 instead of 1. why?
