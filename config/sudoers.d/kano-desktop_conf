# Adding restricted command aliases to kill widgets that have been sudoed from LXPanel taskbar
# The reason behind this is that systemd cannot kill them if sudoed this way for some reason
# The alias allows us to limit the scope of a password-less pkill run as the superuser.
# Look at kano-desktop-lxpanel systemd unit to see usage of these aliases.
#
# Scratch is sudoed from kdesk and suffers from a similar issue.
